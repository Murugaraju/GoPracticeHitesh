		Official definition: A `defer` statement involves a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function returns,
		either because the suttounding function executed a return statement, reached the end of the its function.


		Analogy or normal way of understanding `defer` working in go.
		When ever a function executes it executes line by line

		Imagine all the defer functions appended for execution and at the end of function
		the execution of those function start from LIFO
